                        <h4>Project Description:</h4>
                        <p>For this project, I worked with UI and UX Content to redesign four pages in CDW’s purchase authorization system, or PAS,: the Workflow List page, the Create a New Workflow page, the View/Edit Workflow page, and the Workflow Tutorial page. My focus revolved around mapping a new user flow that would be more pleasant for users and that would guide them through the process while making priority information easy to find and undoable features less accessible. I also focused on reducing clicks and allowing users to see their progress without going back and forth between tasks, as well as updating the design to match other redesigned pages on their site. We began by meeting with subject matter experts who had done a previous redesign of PAS in order to better understand the system. We then performed a heuristic evaluation of the pages using Nielsen’s Heuristics, and used these results in combination with our own research and the input of SMEs to begin wireframing. Throughout the duration of the project, we presented our work to other members of the Product Design team to get feedback and suggestions from more experienced designers. After creating a prototype of the updates made to the user flow of the Create a New Workflow page, I uploaded the prototype to UserTesting, where I created a think-aloud protocol test in which three participants had five tasks in order to create a workflow and publish it. The results of my updates were extremely positive, and participants were pleased with the way that the flow of the page guided them through the process without needing instructions.</p>
